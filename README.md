# CODSOFT Internship Projects

This repository contains the tasks I have completed during my **CodSoft Internship**. Each task demonstrates my skills and learning in Python programming and software development.

## Task 1: To-Do List Application

### Project Overview
The first task of my internship was to create a **To-Do List Application** using Python and Tkinter. This simple app allows users to:
- Add, update, and delete tasks.
- Track completed tasks.
- Save and open task lists from files.

### Features
- **Add Task:** Users can enter a task which gets added to the list with a unique number.
- **Delete Task:** Users can delete tasks by specifying the task number.
- **Update Task:** Users can modify tasks and update the list accordingly.
- **Track Task:** Allows users to mark tasks as completed by striking through them in the list.
- **Save & Load Tasks:** Users can save the current list of tasks to a file and load it later.
